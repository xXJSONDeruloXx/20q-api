# 20Q-ANN: Production-Quality 20 Questions Engine

A sophisticated, production-ready implementation of the classic "20 Questions" game using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach based on a target-object √ó question weight matrix.

## üèÜ Attribution and Inspiration

This project is inspired by and pays homage to the groundbreaking work of **Robin Burgener** and the original **20Q** system. The 20Q concept revolutionized the classic "20 Questions" game by applying artificial intelligence to create an incredibly effective guessing engine.

### The Original 20Q Legacy

- **20Q Website & Handheld Devices**: The original 20Q (twenty-questions.com) and handheld electronic devices became cultural phenomena in the early 2000s, showcasing how AI could create engaging, seemingly "magical" user experiences.

- **Robin Burgener**: The brilliant inventor and creator of the ANN-based 20Q system, who developed the core algorithms and neural network approach that made 20Q so remarkably effective at guessing what people were thinking.

- **Patent Foundation**: This implementation draws inspiration from the methods described in **US Patent 20060230008A1** (*"Method and device for conducting a synthetic interview"*) by Robin Burgener, filed in 2005. This patent describes the fundamental ANN architecture using a weight matrix of objects vs. questions, which forms the theoretical foundation of effective automated questioning systems.

### Historical Context

The original 20Q system was revolutionary because it demonstrated that a relatively simple neural network architecture could achieve human-like intuition in a guessing game. By learning from millions of user interactions, the system developed an understanding of how different questions relate to different objects, creating an AI that seemed to "read minds." This project honors that innovation while providing a modern, extensible implementation of the core concepts.

**Note**: This is an independent implementation created for educational and research purposes. We gratefully acknowledge the pioneering work of Robin Burgener and the original 20Q team.

questions = [
    Question("Is it alive?", "biology"),
    Question("Is it bigger than a car?", "size"),
    Question("Can you eat it?", "food"),
]

# Create game
game = TwentyQuestionsANN(
    objects=["Dog", "Cat", "Car", "Apple"],
    question_manager=QuestionManager(questions),
    confidence_threshold=1.0
)

# Play programmatically
question_idx = game.get_next_question()
if question_idx is not None:
    question_text = game.question_manager.get_question_text(question_idx)
    print(f"Question: {question_text}")
    
    # Submit answer
    game.submit_answer(question_idx, "yes")
    
    # Get best guess when ready
    if game.get_next_question() is None:
        guess, confidence = game.get_best_guess()
        print(f"My guess: {guess} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **TwentyQuestionsANN**: Main game engine with neural network logic
2. **QuestionManager**: Handles questions and multi-valued answer mapping
3. **DemographicManager**: Manages cohort-based weight matrices
4. **WeightIO**: Handles serialization with JSON and binary formats

### ANN Matrix Operations

The core uses a `(n_objects √ó n_questions)` weight matrix with two main modes:

1. **Answer‚ÜíObject Ranking**: Given answers, rank most likely objects
2. **Object‚ÜíQuestion Ranking**: Given top objects, find best discriminating question

*This architecture is inspired by the methodologies described in [US Patent 20060230008A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20060230008A1) by Robin Burgener, which outlines the fundamental approach of using neural networks with object-question weight matrices for automated questioning systems.*

### Question Selection Strategies

- **Balanced Margin**: Finds questions that split candidates most evenly
- **Confirm Top**: Finds questions that best distinguish the top candidate

## üìä Multi-valued Answers

The system supports rich answer types beyond simple yes/no:

| Answer | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| yes | 1.0 | Definitely true |
| no | -1.0 | Definitely false |
| unknown | 0.0 | Don't know |
| sometimes | 0.5 | Sometimes true |
| usually | 0.8 | Usually true |
| rarely | -0.8 | Rarely true |
| maybe | 0.3 | Possibly true |
| probably | 0.7 | Probably true |
| probably_not | -0.7 | Probably false |
| depends | 0.0 | Context-dependent |
| irrelevant | 0.0 | Question doesn't apply |

## üåç Demographic Segmentation

Support for different user populations:

```bash
# List available cohorts
poetry run twentyq stats

# Play with a specific cohort
poetry run twentyq play --cohort us

# Create custom cohort
poetry run twentyq init-weights --objects data/objects.json --questions data/questions.json --output data/priors/cohort_weights/custom.json
```

## üíæ Storage Formats

### JSON Format (Human-readable)
```json
{
  "weights": [[0.1, -0.2], [0.3, 0.4]],
  "shape": [2, 2],
  "dtype": "float32"
}
```

### Binary Format (Compressed)
- 8-bit quantized weights
- 4-10x compression ratio
- Optimized for production deployment

```bash
# Convert between formats
poetry run twentyq convert-weights --input weights.json --output weights.bin
```
